## Experiment 5: Python Dictionaries

### Aim

To study the implementation and practical applications of Python Dictionaries for managing data through key-value pairs.

### Theory

* **Definition**: A dictionary is a collection of items stored as `key: value` pairs.
* **Key-Value Mechanism**: Each key acts as a unique identifier used to retrieve its associated value, similar to an index in a list but using custom labels.
* **Efficiency**: Dictionaries are optimized for fast data retrieval, making them ideal for lookups, such as finding marks by a student's name.
* **Dynamic Nature**: Dictionaries allow for the updating of values for existing keys and the addition of new pairs as needed.

### Algorithm

1. **Define** a dictionary with predefined data (e.g., roll numbers as keys and names as values).
2. **Access** values by passing the specific key into square brackets `[]`.
3. **Update** an existing entry by assigning a new value to a specific key.
4. **Implement Search Logic** using `if key in dictionary` to verify existence before data retrieval to prevent errors.
5. **Develop Authentication** by comparing user-provided input against the values stored for specific administrative or student keys.

### Conclusion

This experiment demonstrated the versatility of Python dictionaries in organizing structured data. I learned how to build functional systems such as a student grade searcher and a basic login credential validator. By using dictionaries, I was able to map complex relationships (like product to price or username to password) and perform efficient updates and lookups, which are essential for database-like operations in programming.

Would you like me to generate a combined table comparing the characteristics of Sets and Dictionaries?
