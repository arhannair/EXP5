## Experiment 5: Python Dictionaries

### Aim

To study the implementation and practical applications of Python Dictionaries for managing data through key-value pairs.

### Theory

* **Definition:** A dictionary is an ordered (as of Python 3.7+) collection of items where data is stored as `key: value` pairs.
* **Keys and Values:** Keys must be unique and immutable (like strings or integers), while values can be of any data type and can repeat.
* **Mapping:** Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data when you know the key, functioning similarly to a real-world directory or map.
* **Functionality:** Dictionaries allow for dynamic updates, such as changing the value associated with an existing key or adding new pairs on the fly.

### Algorithm

1. **Creation:** Define a dictionary using `{key: value}` syntax.
2. **Accessing Data:** Retrieve a value by providing its corresponding key within square brackets `[key]`.
3. **User Input:** Accept input from the user (e.g., a Roll Number or Name) to query the dictionary.
4. **Verification:** Use an `if...in` statement to check if a key exists in the dictionary before accessing it to prevent errors.
5. **Updating:** Modify a value by assigning a new value to an existing key (e.g., `dict[key] = new_value`).
6. **Logic Implementation:** * For authentication, compare user-provided input against the stored value of a specific key.
* For record-keeping, print the value if the search key is found; otherwise, display a "not found" message.
